ðŸ“‹ My Recommendations
Before we dive in, here are my suggestions for the implementation:
Phase 1 - Models & Database (Start Here)

Create custom User model with role-based access
Define all models based on your schema
Set up proper relationships and constraints
Add useful methods (e.g., is_membership_active(), calculate_age())

Phase 2 - Admin Interface

Register models in admin.py
Customize admin displays for better UX
Add filters and search capabilities

Phase 3 - Core Views & URLs

Authentication views (login/logout/register)
Dashboard views (role-based)
CRUD operations for memberships and payments
Walk-in transaction processing

Phase 4 - Templates & Frontend

Base template with navbar and sidebar
Dashboard layouts for each role
Forms for payments and memberships
Responsive design with clean CSS

Phase 5 - Business Logic

Auto-expire memberships
Payment processing workflow
Receipt generation
Analytics calculations
